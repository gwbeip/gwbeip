### Hi there 👋
My research interest includes computer architecture, and hardware accelerator of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) and fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). I have published some papers at IEEE conferences and journals <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CryOyUsAAAAJ"><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2Fgwbeip%2Fgwbeip.github.io%40google-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&amp;logo=Google%20Scholar&amp;labelColor=f6f6f6&amp;color=9cf&amp;style=flat&amp;label=citations"></a>.
