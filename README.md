### Hi there 👋
My research interest includes computer architecture, and hardware accelerator of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) and fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). I have published some papers at IEEE conferences and journals <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CryOyUsAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>.
